Howdoi-Java
====
This repo is a Java implementation of the well known
[howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) library.

It was implemented for fun and I'm not sure if I'll mantain the code
in the future when required.

An IntelliJ IDEA plugin using this library was implemented as well. You can
find it [here](http://github.com/davgomgar/howdoi-intellij)
